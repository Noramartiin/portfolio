                <p>
                  Iâ€™m an Advertisement, Events and Protocol studies lover who
                  has recently discovered programming. Now I'm eager to dive
                  myself into new projects where I can keep improving, keep
                  challenging myself and learn something new everyday.
                </p>
                <p className="quote">
                  With my skills I want to help companies develop their online
                  presence and bussines growth through meaningful experiences.
                </p>

                {!this.state.display ? (
                  <div></div>
                ) : (

                    <h5>How I started in Web Development ?</h5>
                    <p>
                      I remember the first time I watched my first Javascript
                      tutorial, I was surfing the Net when I discovered some
                      random video. I didn't even knew much about HTML or CSS,
                      but that video blew me away! That got me so wrapped up
                      that I started learning the basics with tutorials and free
                      intro courses, I can't put into words the feeling when I
                      saw my first HTML structure on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From that moment, I took it seriously and joined the
                      FullStack Development Bootcamp with IronHack and a whole
                      new world of possibilities opened right in front of my
                      eyes.
                      <b> But that was only the start.</b>
                    </p>
                    <h5>What can I bring to your company ?</h5>
                    <p>
                      As a new hard-working programmer who wants to grow in the
                      profession, I can bring attitude, disposition and desire
                      to take over the world.
                      <strong>
                        But the most important thing is that I would bring
                        freshness to the team, good vibes, sympathy and a more
                        creative way of seeing the world of code.
                      </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Apart from coding, I used to work in Communication &
                      Events what taught me a lot about human thoughts and
                      behaviors. I learned that as a part of a team you would
                      have to work with too different people and its different
                      ways of dealing with errors. This allows you to explore
                      and learn from other thinking processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Apart from that, the most important lesson learned was
                      that when you perform an event, the the human mind tends
                      to forget the content and the specific things, the memory
                      that remains on them are the experiences, and the way that
                      these made them feel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Those of you who are reading this, probably would forget
                      the content of this site the next day, the only thing you
                      will remember will be wheter the feeling when browsing it
                      was positive or not.

                    <p className="quote">
                      That's why the most important thing when creating an
                      event, an app or a webpage is to create something
                      shocking, unexpected and unforgettable for the users.
